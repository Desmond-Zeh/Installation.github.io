Preparatory phase
</h2>
<p>
Make available the following material items in relation to the <strong> installation installed power, distance from the sensor points(Current transformers) to the meter, the network stability in the concerned location</strong>:
<ul>
<li>ITRON SL7000 energy meter (current version).</li>
<li>Current transformers while taking into consideration the following CT sizing criteria:</li>
1. For metering systems where the <strong>distance between the CT and the energy meter is above 10m</strong>, current transformers with a <strong>secondary current of 1A</strong> should be selected.</br>
2. If the above point is vice versa, then current transformers with a <strong>secondary current of 5A</strong> should be selected.</br>
  For proper sizing of Current transformers for metering systems, check out <strong>my CT sizing at:</strong><a href="https://desmond-zeh.github.io/CT.github.io/"><strong>CT sizing for LV metering </strong></a> </br>
<li>ITRON RS232 GPS/GPRS MODEM.</li>
<li>6mm<sup>2</sup> copper cables for the current circuits of the meter.</li>
<li>2.5mm<sup>2</sup> copper cables for the voltage circuits of the meter.</li>
<li>Circuit breakers (iC60N C2A 3P+N) for the protection of the voltage circuits of the meter.</li>
<li>Screws and nuts of sizes <strong> 4mmx16mm, 4mmx20mm and 4mmx25mm</strong> to mount the meter on its carbinet.</li>
<li>Copper cable lugs (flat and round) of sizes <strong>2.5-6, 6-6(PGL and PGC)</strong>.</li>
<li>Cable tie clamps (short and long).</li>
<li>Low Voltage surge protectors.</li>
<li>Low Voltage voltage transformer(optional).</li>
Voltage transformers are not really required in a LV metering system since our <strong>ITRON SL7000</strong> energy meter can operate with LV line voltages ranging from 100V-to-480V.</br>
The voltage instrument transformer is only needed to maintain a pretty stable voltage at the inputs of the energy meter, and as a result protecting the meter from voltage tips across the primary with their saturation ability.</br>

<li>Connecting boxes.</li>
<li>Complete electrician toolkit.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><strong>Installation and Connection phase</strong></h2>
<p>
While onsite, proceed with the installation of the various <strong> metering components </strong> as follows:</br>
<ol>
<li>Cease energy from the working zone. This can be achieve by <strong>opening the main circuit breaker</strong> protecting that zone.</li>
<li>Ensure that the working zone is completely off service by performing the VAV (Voltage Absence Verification) using a suitable measuring tool.</li>
<strong>For the Current transformers' installations</strong></br>
<li>Identify the main current carrying cables powering the installation.</li>
<li>Disconnect the current carrying conductors at the suitable carbinet or point closer to the points where the CT will be installed.</li>
<li>Insert the current carrying conductors through the respective current transformers and wrap the CT fix with the cable tie clamps or using their respective mounting screw (in case of a bar type CT).</li>
<li>Reconnect the current carrying conductors previously disconnected to their respective points.</li>
<li>Measure the <strong>distance</strong> between the CT and the point where the meter and connection boxes will be mounted and cut the <strong>6mm<sup>2</sup> current cables</strong> in relation to the distance measured.</li>
<li>Insert cable lugs (PGC 6-6 or PGL 6-6)using a <strong>crimping plier</strong> onto the both ends of the measured cables.</li>
<li>Connect one end of the current cables to the secondary terminals (S1 and S2) of the CT and ensure that they're well tighted.</li>
<li>Verify the grounding system of the installation and ensure that its resistance falls within the acceptable limit knowing that this values depending on the moisture level of the zone where your found yourself.But in most cases, any value below 8Ω is acceptable.</li>
<li>Ground the Current Transformers at the S2 terminals.</li>
<li>Run the current cables on cable trays or walls of the installation using cable tie clamps, right up to the point where the meter and connection boxes will be mounted.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  <p>
  <strong>For the energy meter and connection boxes' installations</strong></br>
Choose a suitable position for the installation of the meter and connection boxes, while taking into consideration the following points:</br>
1. SL7000 meters are certified for indoor use only. Do not install meters outdoors unless they are housed in an enclosure which can maintain the specified environmental requirements.</br>
2. Meters installed should be safe and void of unwanted attempts. Hence, install meters at a height (>1.5m) from floor level to prevent childred and water from having access to.</br>
3. Digital meters habors many fragile semiconductor components  such as microcontroller, logic gates, LEDs, Capacitors,etc, which can't withstands too much vibrations. Hence, they should be installed in areas with less vibration.</br>
4. Digital meters can operate at temperaures ranging from <strong>-40°C to 75°C</strong>, but a suitable operating temperature is between <strong>20°C to 35°C</strong>.</br>
5. Also take into account the level of humidity(&lt<75% and max:95%).</br>
Open the terminal plastic cover of the meter and mount the energy meter and connection boxes at their respective spots on the carbinet using screws or bolts and nuts and connect the current and voltage cables to it as follows:</br>

<strong>NOTE</strong>
</p>
  <p>
<ul>
<li>The current transformers suitable for metering are measurement transformers with an accuracy class of 0.2-to-1, and suitable burdens.</li>
<li>The single line diagram on how the meter and the current transformers are to be connected to each other is usually found on a paper slit mounted behind the meter's terminal plastic cover.</li>
